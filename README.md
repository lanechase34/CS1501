# CS1501
Algorithm Implementation - Spring 2021

- Project 1 - Implemented a binary search tree and several methods such as delete, in order traversal, reverse, etc.
- Project 2 - Implemented an autocompletion engine using search algorithms and a symbol table using a De La Briandais Trie structure
- Project 3 - Designed and implemented a priority queue backed by a trie data structure to allow easy access to the minimum value and to be able to update the respective values quickly
- Project 4 - Implemented a graph and graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's shortest path, finding a minimum cut, Kruskal's minimum spanning tree, and more
- Project 5 - Wrote a program that simulates Java's Big Integer and implemented algorithms such as multiplication, divison, and extended euclidean to find the GCD
