# CS1501
Algorithm Implementation - Spring 2021

- Project 1 - Implement various functions to better understand a Binary Search Tree
- Project 2 - Implemented an autocompletion engine using search algorithms (De La Briandais trie) and a symbol table to select the next best word based on previous user input
- Project 3 - Implemented a Priority Queue backed by a DLB to allow efficient access to the min value as well as efficiency to update every value in the PQ
- Project 4 - Used a Weighted Graph and PQ to implement various graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's, finding articulation points, Kruskal's minimum spanning tree, and more
- Project 5 - Designed a multiplication and divison algorithm for big integers. Used division to write an extended Euclidean algorithm
